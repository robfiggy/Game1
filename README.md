# Game1

This is my attempt at a Rock, Paper, Scissors game. It is very simple and only returns one window saying what the computer chose after inputting your choice. Here was my process for creating this application:
  - Created an HTML file
  - First tried making an array with the choices of rock, paper, or scissors, but I found it difficult to instruct the computer to      choose randomly from that array 
  - Created two variables - One for a person to make a selection (userChoice) and another for the computer (computerChoice) to make a random selection
  - Made a prompt window that allows players to make a choice
  - Set up the Math.random variable and created various window alerts that correspond to computerChoice
